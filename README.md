# Custom_Object_detection

 I downloaded the images of guitar from google, then I installed the application labelimg through which I gave lables (class)to my image.
 
 I cloned the Darknet Github repository (https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)
 
 Got the train and test data generator from this repository -https://github.com/jakkcoder/training_yolo_custom_object_detection_files
 
 I downloaded the wieghts of pretrained model of YOLO version https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74
 
 Now train the model with help of colab.
 
 ##still I am working on it, I have trained the model and hopefuly I will get the results as soon as possible!!!!


I watched the youtube video(https://youtu.be/hTCmL3S4Obw) for my guidance!


It wasnt easy for me to do this, had to face a tough time resolving the errors which were with respected to system!!!
